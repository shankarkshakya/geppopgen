# Analyses of microsatellite data in R

Hopefully I have covered what microsatellites markers are. Many R packages are available to analyse microsatellite data. We ll be using R package Poppr to analyze the data from Shakya et a. 2018. 

We ll first read the paper and understand what were the objectives of the paper and try to reproduce the work. We ll work as a group.
